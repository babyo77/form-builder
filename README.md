# Form Builder

## Overview  
This project is a responsive web application built to provide a seamless user experience with a focus on pixel-perfect design and interactive elements (**Peerlist Frontend Developer Assignment**)  

## The Making Process  

### 1. **Understanding the Requirements**  
The initial step was to deeply understand the project requirements:  
- The app needed to be pixel-perfect and fully responsive across devices âœ….  
- Subtle animations and interactivity were required to elevate the user experience ( that i neglected ðŸ˜‚).  
- A clean, professional design should drive both functionality and aesthetics âœ….

### 2. **Featurs**  
After reviewing, I moved on to conceptualizing the design:    
- In [Assignment file](https://peerlist.notion.site/Peerlist-Frontend-Developer-Assignment-15471d3131a180b3a41ecce6e83e437b) their were lot if things that are missing also in ui but i m able to add those missing things and yes thire are more.
- **save form submission**:i saved form data in db as well as when user vising the form again after submitting once.

### 3. **Development Phases**  
The project was broken into clear phases for smoother execution:  
- **Layout Structure**  
  Focused on building the app layout and basic HTML structure, ensuring essential content elements were in place.  
- **Design Refinement and API integration**  
  Styled the layout with **TailwindCSS**, refining spacing, typography, and colors to ensure consistency with design.  
- **Testing & Polishing**  
  Performed rigorous testing across devices to ensure responsiveness, making adjustments as needed for smaller screens or edge cases.    

### 4. **Problem-Solving During Development**  
Several challenges arose during the development process, requiring creative solutions:  
- **Contententeditable**:  
  Managing the state of a Contententeditable, hardest part gone through but managed to cover, but still there are minor fixes to be fixed.
- **Drag-Drop**:First it was bit upside down as i was impleting it from scratch without using any external library at last i managed to add drap drop features    

### Other points

- **Time**:managed to make a backend with caching at same time for this [Backend code](https://github.com/babyo77/form-builder-backend)
- **Forgot**:forgot to add many thing as far as i was builing i thought of adding all features ðŸ˜‚
